I've just found out that if your (un)trusty text editor or (un)helpful spreadsheet program that handles CSV files use MAC line endings (\r) by default , you'll have trouble setting the table rates in Magento.

The code splits the content of the CSV file on UNIX line endings (\n) so without them your CSV file will never be read.

So if you have a MAC and the export of your Table Rate shipping is always blank then now you know why.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='' alt='' /></div>
