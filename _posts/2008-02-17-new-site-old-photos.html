<p>hurray! i've finally found some evening time to create a flex/flash9 based image viewer for my old (+new) black and white +some colour photos. they can be found at this site's <a href="http://www.n3ru.net/">index page</a>. most of the photos are scans of prints i made from the years 98 and on. some are new [digital - from my new nikon]. i'll hopefully be developing the flash viewer to allowing indexing of individual photos later.<br />
with this new development we poignantly went to the ansel adams exhibit at <a href="http://www.cac.org.uk/venues/whatson.htm" target='_blank'>the city art gallery</a>. worth a visit to see prints such as <a target='_blank' href="http://www.hcc.commnet.edu/artmuseum/anseladams/details/moonrise.html">Moonrise, Hernandez, New Mexico 1941</a>, which was taken in a single guessed exposure before the light was lost. inspiring.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5008773-4314124001916523819?l=enrutech.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
