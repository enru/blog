Guinness out of a can will never taste as good again. Yes, it does taste better there. This image was taken in the Guinness Storehouse. Some other photos from the city can be seen on <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/enru/sets/72157614227461631/'>flickr</a>, including this one, which was surprisingly found outside of Scotland.</p>
