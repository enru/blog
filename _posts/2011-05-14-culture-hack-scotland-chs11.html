<a href="#slides">TL;DR</a> ? <a href="#slides">jump to the slideshow</a>

Last weekend (May 6-7th 2011) I attended <a href="http://culturehackscotland.com">Culture Hack Scotland</a> (l#chs11) at Inspace/Informatics in Edinburgh. It was a dual streamed hackday aimed at uniting the cultural &amp; technical communities. The day's ambition was to inspire both set of people to create something together on top of recently released <a href="http://culturehackscotland.com/about/data">data</a> from the Edinburgh Festivals and other Scottish cultural organisations.

In the run up to the event I began to think about what I could do with all the data that had been made available. Initially I thought about presenting the data in some way, something to do with words, spinning on the words = culture = ideas side of things. Quite a few of <a href="http://culturehackscotland.com/showcase">the resulting hacks</a> ended up presenting the data in a visual &amp; in some cases aural way.

I would have liked to work on some of the festival data in this way or worked with some other people in a team but in the end I came up with an idea I wanted to hack on solo. I also wanted to come up with an idea that was achievable in the time-frame that was available.

In search of a 'useful' hack I had started to think about an average festival go-ers experience and how busy the festival can be. Having glanced over this article on <a href="http://festivalslab.com/short-term-social-networks/">Short Term Social Networks</a> by <a>Festival Labs</a> I thought about how an individual might quickly access &amp; share their experience about an event or show.

I wanted to make people's feedback for an event or performance much more immediate. I wanted people to carry the buzz and chat they have post-performance on to the event's website as soon as the show was finished. I also wanted to make it as easy as possible to find out information about a show and the feedback others were giving it either before, during or after a performance. This was my eureka moment.

Having since spoken to a few people about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code">QR (Quick Response) codes</a> I think there's a general negative feeling towards them amongst tech people. I suspect this might be due to their heavy use by the Advertising &amp; Marketing industry or because they are a very low-tech solution - encoded data printed on paper.

<img style="border:none;" class="size-full wp-image-80 alignright" title="qrchat" src="http://enrutech.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/qrchat240.png" alt="qrch.at qr code link" width="240" height="240" />

Nevertheless, I like them. I think the interaction they require - scanning an image with a smart phone - is fun &amp; engages the user rather than a passive (from the point of view of the user) location aware application. I think they suit the requirements of my project well. They can be placed anywhere, a URL to a website can be encoded into them &amp; they are instantly recognisable once you know what they are.

My use of <a href="http://disqus.com">disqus.com</a> to provide a user/comment/feedback system was quite simply for ease of use. They have already spent a great deal of time addressing the area of commenting &amp; discussion on the web. They also have a mobile theme that would automatically get used on smart phones and the facility to place a disqus.com thread on multiple domains/websites.

Using these two technologies together was what got me excited. It was, in my mind, a true hack - bringing together existing technologies and making something new out of them.

At this point I retreated &amp; thought long &amp; hard about how I might share this idea. I had a firm idea of how I wanted the skeleton of the app to work. It was such a simple hack I wasn't sure how another developer/hacker would be able to help in the build. I had been working on a mobile web app at the time and was keen to retry some code I had developed for a menu based mobile user interface.
<p style="float:left;width:80%;">The night of the event came and the organisers had clearly put a lot of work into creating what was an awesome environment. A <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/getambition/5695137655/in/pool-1687201@N21">twitter ball</a>; the words: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/54907132@N07/5694647354/in/pool-1687201@N21">'hack'</a>, 'culture' &amp; 'exciting' projected over the white walls; talks &amp; videos; drinks &amp; chat. There was a real buzz about the place that evening. Prompted by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/hackscotland/status/65172746811879424">@hackscotland</a>'s words "genius ideas only get better through sharing" I jumped in &amp; nervously pitched my idea when the call for ideas came up. I didn't know what I was going to achieve by broadcasting my idea when I didn't need another hacker but I just wanted to put it out there in the spirit of the event.</p>
<p style="float:left;width:80%;">Dinner was laid on for the developers &amp; we all started to chat about our ideas &amp; work on them. I found it difficult to work in such a busy environment and was a bit over stimulated by the whole evening so I decided to go home &amp; hack there.</p>

The next morning I went back to the Informatics building to a room full of hackers coding away. I already had a working prototype of my application - <a href="http://qrch.at">qrchat</a> - working so I spent the rest of the day polishing it off and checking the menu system worked on both Android &amp; iPhone browsers. I should probably have spent some time creating a login system to allow others to create their own <a href="http://qrch.at">qrchat</a> page but to honest my brain was a bit fried. I'm a new dad and survive on about 5 hours sleep a night as it is! My time wasn't wasted though I did have the time to help some others.

OK - so <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/danfrydman">@danfrydman</a> is my boss in my day job &amp; it was very simple 5 line PHP script that I wrote but <em>hey!</em> there <em>was</em> collaboration going on :-) I also snapped some photos for <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/_janem">Jannete Mensch</a> and played around with Callum Macdonald's <a href="http://www.callum-macdonald.com/2011/05/08/my-experience-at-chs11/">#tagrrd</a> hack, one of the other QR code projects.

At the end of the Saturday afternoon tools were downed &amp; the hacking stopped. We all gave presentations of what we'd created. I gave a very rushed talk - I thought they were meant to be quick! All the hacks were great &amp; the presentations were very slick. In hindsight, I should have prepared my talk more - I had had the time to spare - but hey, it was my first hackday &amp; I'm not used to presenting stuff. I must have got my idea across well enough though because one of the judges deemed my hack worthy enough of a mention &amp; I got this <a href="http://www.artofimmersion.com/frank-rose.html/">interesting book</a> as a prize.

All in all it was a great event &amp; the organisers clearly put a lot of effort into making it so. <strong>Thanks!</strong> <em>IT WAS AWESOME!</em> I hope to find the time to develop <a href="http://qrch.at">qrchat</a> further. In the meantime if anybody wants a <a href="http://qrch.at">qrchat</a> page then just let me know by emailing <strong>qrchat @ enru.co.uk</strong>.
