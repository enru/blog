spent much of today cursing my mac for not ssh'ing into a new rackspace server some kind of network issue as it works fine in other locations. so downloaded a trial of parallels and a new debian netinst cd iso which works wonderfully. so much so that i may fork out the Â£40 -odd to buy a license. oh linux how i've missed you...<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='' alt='' /></div>
