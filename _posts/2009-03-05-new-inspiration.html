I've found new inspiration. David Burnett is a photographer that has shot varied subjects including major Sports Events, World Politicians, News and Current Affairs. He has managed to do it with a great deal of style. By using film cameras, such as <a href="http://www.lomography.com/holga/">Holgas</a> and old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_Graphic">Speed Graphics</a>, as well as Digital SLRs, he's managed to keep his images interesting and exciting.

<p>I was introduced to him through <a href="http://www.worldpressphoto.org/index.php?option=com_media_gallery&amp;area=showGallery&amp;task=view&amp;id=10&amp;Itemid=180&amp;bandwidth=high">this video</a> which I found somewhere. If you have a spare 90 minutes, I thoroughly recommend it, even if you're not a keen photographer. He has some amusing anecdotes, such as how he used to have to "shift film" to the States by approaching sympathetic travellers in airports and asking them to carry film to New York for him.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/5008773-5369815266839021649?l=enrutech.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
