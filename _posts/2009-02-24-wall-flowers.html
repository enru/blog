<p>I took my OM2 out for a spin on Saturday and surprisingly shot a whole 36 roll. I remember when I considered film so expensive. I'd be so precious that I'd take a week to run one down. Even so, the ratio of good shots to bad is still about 1:9.</p>

<p>I spent a good while looking at this piece of masonry and the opposing flower arrangement. I can't recall consciously considering the juxtaposition and only really appreciated this shot once it was processed and scanned. </p>

<p>I'm having some difficulty making myself photograph people right now. Feeling a little slow on the tempo and thinking about how to move to working in medium format as an alternative. Maybe more photos in this vein is the way to go right now.</p><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='' alt='' /></div>
