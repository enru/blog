Still not upgraded all of our <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/">Magento</a> sites to the 1.4 release.

Here's how to upgrade the 1.3 release via PEAR without upgrading all the way to 1.4:

<pre>
./pear mage-setup . 
./pear upgrade magento-core/Mage_All_Latest-1.3.3
</pre><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='' alt='' /></div>
