<p>This year, as I've got back into Photography, I've been thinking about alternative modes of photo taking to the fast paced shutter gun approach of Street Photography that I have adopted so far. As a way of slowing things down I started to think about using a Twin Lens Reflex camera. And so, a few weeks ago I bought a Lubitel2 from some guy for Â£20. There's a slight bit of something on the viewing lens but otherwise it's in great condition and a great deal cheaper than a Yashica Mat from eBay.</p>

<p>So one fine morning last week I took my new Lubitel out on a walk with the dog, a tripod and a cable release. There is some thing quite satisfying about slowly setting up a shot in the cold and the mud, to then expose it with a relaxed press of the cable release. By the end of the walk, I was imagining myself as a pioneering photographer with a large glass plate negative camera.</p>
