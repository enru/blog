On deploying Magento sites, we always seem to run into an issue with Magento's sort by price option on product listings. Previously, in test with a few products this could be solved by going into the Admin Panel at System-&gt;Cache Management and hitting "Refresh now" next to <em>Layered Navigation Indices</em>. Now in production with many more products this refresh option times out and gives a White Screen of Death.
</p> 

<p>
This <a href='http://chrismckee.co.uk/magento-commerce-layered-navigation-cache-error/'>post</a> pointed me to how to fix the issue. ... but being too lazy to download someone's code, I've found a way to fix it without any external scripts. It involves using Magento's cron feature to run the catalog reindexer by temporally editing a config file and manipulating the DB.
</p>

<p>
After trying to refresh the Layered Navigation Indice and the page hangs, a flag gets set in the core_flag DB table. We need to clear this otherwise the reindexing will never happen again. To reset it do as <a href='http://chrismckee.co.uk/magento-commerce-layered-navigation-cache-error/'>Chris</a> says and empty the table using:
</p> 

<pre>
TRUNCATE core_flag;
</pre>

<p>Now that's clear we're going to force the reindexing to run from the CLI by editing a config file and running Magento's cron.php</p>

<p>The cron feature of Magento normally handles the reindexing of catalogindex_price. 
The config for it lives in app/code/core/Mage/CatalogIndex/etc/config.xml. 
Here's the section we'll be paying attention to:</p>

<pre>
    
        
            
                0 2 * * *
                catalogindex/observer::reindexAll
            
            
                * * * * *
                catalogindex/observer::runQueuedIndexing
            
        
    
</pre>

<p>When we run cron.php we want to force the catalogindex/observer::reindexAll method to run. 
So, edit the schedule/cron_expr node from:

<pre>
                0 2 * * *
</pre>

<p> to </p>

<pre>
                * * * * *
</pre>

<p>
Once that's done you'll need to reset the cache in Magento's 
admin panel, so that the new config is reloaded. You'll also need to 
'Queue Refresh' of the <em>Layered Navigation</em> 
while you're in the Cache Management page. 
This will insert a row in the core_flag table:
</p>

<pre>
mysql&gt; select * from core_flag;
+---------+--------------+-------+-----------+---------------------+
| flag_id | flag_code    | state | flag_data | last_update         |
+---------+--------------+-------+-----------+---------------------+
|    1285 | catalogindex |     1 | N;        | 2010-02-18 14:58:17 |
+---------+--------------+-------+-----------+---------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

mysql&gt; 
</pre>

<p>
Re-cached we're ready to re-index by running the cron.php directly:
</p>

<pre>
# /usr/bin/php cron.php 
</pre>

<p>
Once you're done - don't forget to revert your changes to 
app/code/core/Mage/CatalogIndex/etc/config.xml 
and to refresh your Magento cache :)
