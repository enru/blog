Following my discovery of David Burnett's inspired use of a Holga, I went out and managed to take some shots of people with my own. I've modded my  Holga to use a wider aperture by removing the aperture ring that sits behind the lens. I've also widened the aperture by gouging out a wider hole. As the shutter is at a fixed speed, hopefully this wider aperture should allow more light into the camera (which more suits the Scottish quality of light). However, the depth of field doesn't seem to be have been affected too much by this hacking, so who know if it's helped or not. I've kept the ring that I popped out and intend to enable the sunny switch by gluing it to the arm that the aperture switch moves. This switch is normally useless on a non-modified Holga.
